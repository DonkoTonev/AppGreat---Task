# Project Title

Notes App

## Introduction

This is the Notes App that I managed to develop in around 3-4 hours. For the front-end I used React.js, and for the back-end I used Node.js.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Node.js installed on your system.

### Front-End Installation

To set up the front-end part of the project, follow these steps:

```bash
cd Client
npm install
npm run dev
```


### Back-End Installation

To set up the back-end part of the project, follow these steps:

```bash
npm install dotenv
node app.js
```


# To-Do

## Features that I Wanted To Implement If I had More Time

- **User Authentication:** Implement user authentication to allow users to have individual accounts and save their notes securely. Consider using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for maintaining session states.
- **Database Integration:** Integrate a database system like MongoDB or PostgreSQL to store notes persistently. This will replace any temporary storage mechanisms currently in place.
- **Rich Text Support:** Allow users to format their notes with options like bold, italic, underline, and bullet points for better note organization.
- **Search Functionality:** Implement a search feature to enable users to quickly find specific notes based on keywords or tags.
- **Tagging System:** Introduce a tagging system for notes to categorize them easily and facilitate searching.
- **Mobile Responsiveness:** Ensure the app is fully responsive and usable on various mobile devices and screen sizes.
- **Dark Mode:** Introduce a dark mode theme to reduce eye strain and accommodate user preference for low-light conditions.
